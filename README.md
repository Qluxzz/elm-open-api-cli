# Elm API SDK Generator

Generate an Elm SDK from an OpenAPI Spec (OAS).

## Goal

To allow developers to generate an Elm module(s) from an OpenAPI Spec. This is primarily for developers wanting to integrate with a 3rd party service that doesn't provide an Elm SDK for their service. It can also be used within a company where the back end generates an OAS from the written code or an OAS is written and used to generate both the backend and Elm SDKs.

## Example Usage

[A RealWorld app](https://github.com/wolfadex/realworld-app) using a generated SDK to demonstrate how to use it.
