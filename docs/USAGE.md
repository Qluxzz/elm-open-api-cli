# Using the CLI

### Install the CLI:

- `npm install -D elm-open-api`

### Run the CLI:

- `npx elm-open-api ./page/to/oas.json`

### Arguments you can pass:

- `<entryFilePath>`: The path to the Open API Spec, either `.json` or `.y[a]ml`
  - Technically the OAS allows for parts of a spec to be in separate files, but this isn't supported yet.
- `[--output-dir <output dir>]`: The directory to output to. Defaults to `generated/`.
- `[--module-name <module name>]`: The Elm module name. Default to `<OAS info.title>`.
- `[--auto-convert-swagger]`: If passed in, and a Swagger doc is encountered, will attempt to convert it to an Open API file. If not passed in, and a Swagger doc is encountered, the user will be manually prompted to convert.
- `[--swagger-conversion-url]`: The URL to use to convert a Swagger doc to an Open API file. Defaults to `https://converter.swagger.io/api/convert`.
- `[--swagger-conversion-command]`: Instead of making an HTTP request to convert from Swagger to Open API, use this command.
- `[--swagger-conversion-command-args]`: Additional arguments to pass to the Swagger conversion command, before the contents of the Swagger file are passed in.
- `[--generateTodos <generateTodos>]`: Whether to generate TODOs for unimplemented endpoints, or fail when something unexpected is encountered. Defaults to `no`. To generate `Debug.todo ""` instead of failing use one of: `yes`, `y`, `true`.

## Example outputs:

Assume we have an OAS file named `my-cool-company-oas.json` and it has a field `"title": "My Coool Company"` and we run the CLI like so

```sh
npx elm-open-api ./my-cool-company-oas.json
```

then we'll output like

```sh
ðŸŽ‰ SDK generated:

    generated/MyCooolCompany/Api.elm
    generated/MyCooolCompany/OpenApi.elm


You'll also need elm/http and elm/json installed. Try running:

    elm install elm/http
    elm install elm/json


and possibly need elm/bytes and elm/url installed. If that's the case, try running:
    elm install elm/bytes
    elm install elm/url
```

That's nice, but maybe we want to have a less specific module name. We could instead run

```sh
npx elm-open-api ./my-cool-company-oas.json --module-name="My.Comp"
```

which would result in

```sh
ðŸŽ‰ SDK generated:

    generated/My/Comp/Api.elm
    generated/My/Comp/OpenApi.elm


You'll also need elm/http and elm/json installed. Try running:

    elm install elm/http
    elm install elm/json


and possibly need elm/bytes and elm/url installed. If that's the case, try running:
    elm install elm/bytes
    elm install elm/url
```

Notice the new path (and Elm module name) for the `Api.elm` and `OpenApi.elm` files.

Alternatively, maybe we have a different directory naming scheme for our project. We could do

```sh
npx elm-open-api ./my-cool-company-oas.json --output-dir="src"
```

which gives us

```sh
ðŸŽ‰ SDK generated:

    src/MyCooolCompany/Api.elm
    src/MyCooolCompany/OpenApi.elm


You'll also need elm/http and elm/json installed. Try running:

    elm install elm/http
    elm install elm/json


and possibly need elm/bytes and elm/url installed. If that's the case, try running:
    elm install elm/bytes
    elm install elm/url
```

This time only the root directory has changed.
